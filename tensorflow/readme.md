Tensorflow files
================

This directory contains implementations using TensorFlow, which I used before
I decided to switch to PyTorch for this project.

These scripts require TensorFlow, and `fedavg-tff.py` requires
`tensorflow-federated`. To install these requirements:

``` bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-federated
```
