"""Configuration.

Reads the config.json file, and sets relevant attributes of itself accordingly.
Configuration variables should be accessed as, for example:

    from config import DATA_DIRECTORY, RESULTS_DIRECTORY

This uses some Python magic, but hopefully not too obscure. Its purpose is to
try to allow imports of the style above, without having to catch `ImportError`
everywhere the `config` module is used if `config.py` didn't exist.
